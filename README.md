# CSS layout with Grid and Flexbox

This is a small starter project, which you can clone in order to code along.

It includes an `index.html` file full of lorem ipsum, with images from [Pexels](https://pexels.com) and some basic styling (`reset.css` to remove all default styles, `generals.css` to make it look pretty, and `layout.css`, which we'll be populating live).
